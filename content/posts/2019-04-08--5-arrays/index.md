You can store a sequence of any type of data in an array. Arrays can look like:

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape' ]
const number = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const coordinates = [[1,2], [5,3], [4,5]]
```

Arrays are used to store the same type of data. With array methods, you can manipulate, add, loop over, or get data out of your array. The fastest way to get access to an element in an array is by using its index.

Indexes of arrays start at 0, so the very first element in an array has index 0. You can access this element by using the array’s name, followed by brackets. 

```javascript
const numbers = [192, 895, 324, 565]

// The first element in the array, 192, has index 0
numbers[0] // 192
numbers[1] // 895
numbers[2] // 324
```

Let’s quickly get to array [methods](/6-arrays-methods) to see what wonderful things we can do with our lists of data.
